        identity disorder have long fascinated and eluded science, it is believed that some can also manifest unique physical 
        attributes for each personality, a cognitive and physiological prism within a single being. Though Kevin has evidenced
         23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist, Dr. Fletcher, there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize
          and dominate all the others. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful, observant Casey,
           Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him - as well as everyone around him - as the 
           walls between his compartments shatter apart.</p>
